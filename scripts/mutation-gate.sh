# mutation-gate.sh — per-package mutation thresholds (RATCHET, raise-only).
# The single entrypoint: `make mutation` and the CI workflow both call only
# this script, so local and CI cannot diverge. Thresholds live in
# .mutation-thresholds.
#
# Usage: mutation-gate.sh [package ...]     (default: every package in the module)
#
# Runs gremlins once per package — NEVER with a `...` wildcard, which gremlins
# does not expand: it silently generates zero mutants and exits 0. A real service
# shipped a gate built on `gremlins unleash ./internal/...` and it measured
# nothing at all through eight tasks while reporting success on every PR.
#
# Fails when a package is below its threshold, is missing from
# .mutation-thresholds, or produces no mutants without declaring NONE.
