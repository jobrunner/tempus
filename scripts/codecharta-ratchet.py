"""CodeCharta ratchet gate.

CodeCharta is a visualizer; it has no built-in "fail when worse". This turns its
merged map into three ratchets over metrics that aren't already gated elsewhere
(per-package coverage has its own floors in .coverage-floors; mutation testing is
the separate gremlins gate):

  1. Complexity cap — no file may exceed its cap on the per-file SUM of function
     complexity. Files listed in the baseline are capped at their recorded value (so
     they can't grow); everything else is capped at default_cap. This stops a file
     becoming a monolith, but is satisfiable by splitting a file (the sum moves with
     the code). Ratchet: lower the numbers as code is simplified.
  1b. Function-complexity cap — same shape, on max_complexity_per_function (the single
     most complex function in a file). This is the overall-complexity control that
     canNOT be gamed by moving code between files: a function keeps its complexity
     wherever it lives, so passing requires actually simplifying the function.
  2. Hotspot gate — a file that is both complex (complexity >= min_complexity) and
     under-tested (line_coverage < min_coverage) fails, unless it is grandfathered
     in `allow`. This blocks NEW complex-and-untested files; shrink `allow` as the
     existing ones get tests.

Usage: codecharta-ratchet.py <map.cc.json[.gz]> [config.json]
Exit codes: 0 = within ratchet, 1 = a metric regressed (per-file report),
2 = usage / unreadable input / malformed map.
